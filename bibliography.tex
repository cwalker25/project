\section{Take Home Exam 1}
This document sets up the procedure and the thought process for the experiment.  
Dr. Slaton begins the document by explaining the processes of a nine volt batteries chemical reaction.As \cite{take_home} states," the battery is considered "Dead" when the voltage reaches 4.8'. The worksheet goes on to state the purpose for the 9V battery is to used in situations with low current draw for long periods of time. The next paragraph describe the circuit that was should be set up during the experiment. The last section of the worksheet explains the physics behind the experiment, and lists the requirements the test should meet.
